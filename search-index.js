代码以及设置参数和获取结果集的工作。MyBatis 可以通过简单的 XML 或注解来配置和映射原始类型、接口和 Java POJO（Plain Old Java Objects，普通老式 Java 对象）为数据库中的记录。 第一，MyBatis 本身就是一款设计非常精良、架构设计非常清晰的持久层框架，并且 MyBatis 中还使用到了很多经典的设计模式，例如，工厂方法模式、适配器模式、装饰器模式、代理模式等。 在阅读 MyBatis 代码的时候，你也许会惊奇地发现：原来大师设计出来的代码真的是一种艺术。所以，从这个层面来讲，深入研究 MyBatis 原理，甚至阅读它的源码，不仅可以帮助你快速解决工作中遇到的 MyBatis 相关问题，还可以提高你的设计思维。 第二，MyBatis 提供了很多扩展点，例如，MyBatis 的插件机制、对第三方日志框架和第三方数据源的兼容等。 正由于这种可扩展的能力，让 MyBatis 的生命力非常旺盛，这也是很多 Java 开发人员将 MyBatis 作为自己首选 Java 持久化框架的原因之一，反过来促进了 MyBatis 用户的不断壮大。 第三，开发人员使用 MyBatis 上手会非常快，具有很强的易用性和可靠性。这也是 MyBatis 流行的一个很重要的原因。当你具备了 MySQL 和 JDBC 的基础知识之后，学习 MyBatis 的难度远远小于 Hibernate

(1) } 1 最终注入容器的是一个 MapperProxy 对象 MapperProxy org.mybatis.spring.support.SqlSessionDaoSupport#getSqlSession public SqlSession getSqlSession() { return this.sqlSessionTemplate; (1) } 1 返回一个 SqlSession 类型的对象 SqlSessionTemplate org.springframework.cloud.openfeign.MapperFactoryBean#loadBalance public void setSqlSessionFactory(SqlSessionFactory sqlSessionFactory) { // sqlSessionTemplate 覆盖 sqlSessionFactory if (this.sqlSessionTemplate == null || sqlSessionFactory != this.sqlSessionTemplate.getSqlSessionFactory()) { this.sqlSessionTemplate = createSqlSessionTemplate(sqlSessionFactory); (1) } } 1 使用 SqlSessionFactory 初始化 SqlSessionTemplate org.springframework.cloud.openfeign.MapperFactoryBean#get protected SqlSessionTemplate createSqlSessionTemplate( SqlSessionFactory sqlSessionFactory) { return new SqlSessionTemplate(sqlSessionFactory); } getMapper 方法中调用 Configuration#getMapper() 方法，最终得到返回的 MapperProxy 对象注入到 SpringContext 中。 org.mybatis.spring.SqlSessionTemplate#getMapper public T getMapper(Class type) { return getConfiguration().getMapper(type, this); (1) } 1 保存在 Configuration 全局对象中 Configuration SqlSessionFactoryBean 实现了 FactoryBean 接口和 InitializingBean 接口。 SqlSessionFactoryBean 一般是手动注入，它内部持有了 Mybatis 的全局配置对象 Configuration 。 org.mybatis.spring.SqlSessionFactoryBean#afterPropertiesSet public void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception { notNull(dataSource, \"Property 'dataSource' is required\"); notNull(sqlSessionFactoryBuilder, \"Property 'sqlSessionFactoryBuilder' is required\"); state((configuration == null && configLocation == null) || !(configuration != null && configLocation != null), \"Property 'configuration' and 'configLocation' can not specified with together\"); this.sqlSessionFactory = buildSqlSessionFactory(); (1) } 1 代替了 org.apache.ibatis.session.SqlSessionFactoryBuilder#build 方法。 org.mybatis.spring.SqlSessionFactoryBean#buildSqlSessionFactory protected SqlSessionFactory buildSqlSessionFactory() throws Exception { final Configuration targetConfiguration;
